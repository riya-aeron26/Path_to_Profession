# Path_to_Profession
At the start of our college journey, we often find ourselves in a state of uncertainty. This 
uncertainty arises from our lack of clarity regarding which skills to prioritize, primarily due to 
the ever-changing nature of the job market and technological advancements. As the future 
remains unpredictable, we embark on our project with the goal of providing students with the 
necessary guidance to navigate this uncertainty effectively. Our aim is to help them identify and 
acquire the skills that will best serve them for their brighter future. To achieve this, we are 
developing a mobile application with a dashboard created using Power BI. Through this 
application, we intend to provide valuable insights, such as the availability of jobs in different 
cities across India and the specific skills demanded by these jobs. Additionally, we will include a 
regression plot for each job type, along with all the skills required for that particular job.
